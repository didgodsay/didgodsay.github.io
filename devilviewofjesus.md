title: The devil's View of Jesus
--- 

Summary:

1. The devil was unsure that Jesus is God incarnate
2. Atonement doesn't make sense to the devil

---

When the devil 'tempts' Jesus, he offers power in exchange for worship:

> Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, “All these I will give you, ***if you will fall down and worship me***.” (Matthew 4:8-9)


> And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. ***If you, then, will worship me***, it will all be yours.” (Luke 4:5-7)

Although the devil does not understand God's love, he is fully aware of his status and power. He has witnessed the sinless life of Jesus and his recent baptism, but he wouldn't ask Jesus to worship him if he was sure that Jesus is the incarnate Son of God. However the expansive nature of the temptation shows that he has his suspicions.

Having his suspicions confirmed, or at least reinforced, the devil backs off 'until an opportune time'. But what is the opportunity he is looking for? He wants to prove that mankind is irredeemably rebellious and must be destroyed. 'he is always looking for opportunities to bring this to God's attention, so that he may become the agent of judgement:

> But stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.” (Job 1:11)

> “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat (Luke 22:32)

What greater proof could there be that mankind cannot be redeemed than that they would kill the Son of God *and believe that they are doing good* as they do it? Satan eagerly encourages the unfolding drama of the cross. He senses vindication. Why would God atone for mankind when they are shown to be capable of this depth? Jesus own parable suggests the fury of God will overflow in judgement at that moment:

> And he began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard and let it out to tenants and went into another country for a long while. When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. And he sent another servant. But they also beat and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed. And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded and cast out. Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’ But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.’ ***And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.”*** When they heard this, they said, “Surely not!” But he looked directly at them and said, “What then is this that is written:
>
> “‘The stone that the builders rejected  
>  has become the cornerstone’?
>
> Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.”  
(Luke 20-9-18)

So the devil looks to the cross for victory. The Son of God is murdered by man, by the religious elite from among the people He set aside for His own possession. No greater or more final act of rebellion is possible. Why, oh why, would God not now bring down the curtain of history in final judgement on Adam. Instead, God atones for sin in His own body, and tears down the curtain of death:

> And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. (Mark 15:38)

> Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places ***by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain***, that is, through his flesh (Hebrews 10:19-20)

This disgusts the devil, as it also offends many people who have a strong sense of Good and Evil, but do not understand that sitting ourselves in God's judgement seat is the only sin He will never forgive.
